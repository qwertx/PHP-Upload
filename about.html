      This site was made by <a class="no-link" href="http://qwertxzy.moe">qwertxzy</a> to learn more about PHP, but if you want to use it, that's great! <br>
      Anyway I would never been able to do this without the help of <a class="no-link" href="http://quad.moe">Quad</a>, so go thank him too. <br><br>
      I would just like you to not upload illegal stuff like the childporn I mentioned in the disclaimer, because I think it's my responsibility for what I provide throughout the internet, and I never wanted to provide fapping material to pedophiles, please respect that.  <br>
      If you have any tips, any feedback or something, please contact me via <a class="no-link" href="http://www.twitter.com/qwertxzy">Twitter</a> or some other way, you can find most of them on my <a class="no-link" href="http://qwertxzy.moe">Homepage</a>. I'd really appreciate that, because I know my UI Design is shit and I'm sorry for that - it may improve someday.
